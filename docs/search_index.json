The raw data is an xlsx file with 13 tables about UK GDP. We make use of table 5 which is UK’s Gross domestic product at current market prices. Website: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/datasets/regionalgrossdomesticproductallnutslevelregions Manipulation: We use excel to extract only the regional GDP over years and output the new data table as a csv file with name uk_gdp.csv. london_earnings_by_borough.csv Description: This dataset is from the Datathon materials and details information on the pay of workers in various regions of the UK from 2002 to 2019. The dataset has 6 variables, of which we make use of year, area, and pay variables. Year details the year of the datapoint’s collection. Area details the area in the UK of the worker for whom the datapoint was collected. Pay details the pay in hours or weekly. Manipulation: We convert hourly pay to weekly pay by dropping any rows that have either no pay_type or no pay, and then multiplying all hourly pay by 40 to get weekly pay under the assumption of a 40 hour work week. UK_international-visits.csv Description: This dataset, also from the provided Datathon materials, details the activity of various groups of international visitors to regions of the UK from the years 2002 to 2019. The dataset has 11 variables, and we make use of the year, quarter, area, visits, spend, and nights variables among these. Year details the year of the visit, and quarter details its quarter. Manipulation: We can combine these two variables together to produce a year + quarter variable with entries of the form 2XXXQY (e.g. 2015Q3 would be quarter 3 of 2015). Area details the region the visitors visited. Visits, spend, and nights are the number of visits made by the group samples, the amount spent by the group sampled (in millions of £), and the total number of nights spent in the area detailed by the group sampled respectively. 2.2 Data for Analysis of Canada 2.3 Data for Analysis of Brazil brazil_gdp.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 4 variables: state, region, year, value. The variable region is a smaller region in state. It covers Brazil GDP from year 2002 to 2017. Manipulation: Since the raw data is on a state-level of Brazil GDP over years, we add an additional variable larger_region to indicate which of the 5 regions a row belongs to. The regional division criteria is in section 5. The raw data has GDP values in thousands of Reals. For better visualization, we modify the unit to trillions of Reals. For regional GDP calculation, we simply add the GDP value of all states within one larger region to get the result. For regional GDP growth rate calculation, we use the formula: (value of this year - value of last year)/value of last year, and keep two decimals for the percentage of growth rate. For increasing rate calculation by using other tables in section 5, we use the same formula. brazil_monthly_income.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 5 variables: year, quarter, job_type, state, value. It covers Brazil monthly income from year 2012 to 2020. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. This data has missing values, we choose to drop all missing values. Also, for the ridgeline plot and histograms in section 5.2, we remove higher outliers by using the criteria: \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. Points above the criteria are defined to be higher outliers. For each region’s average monthly income, we take the mean of all data points within one region. brazil_unemployment.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 5 variables: year, quarter, category, state, value. It covers Brazil unemployment from year 2012 to 2019. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. For unemployment rate calculation, we first calculate the total workforce. Then use the formula: Unemployment Rate = Number of Unemployment/Workforce, where Workforce = Number of Unemployment + Number of Employment. Then we take the mean to get the average yearly unemployment rate. brazil_tourism_jobs.csv Description: This dataset is from Datathon Materials which has 6 variables: year, month, region, state, job_type,jobs. It covers Brazil tourism jobs from year 2006 to 2018. Manipulation: We add an additional variable larger_region to indicate Brazil’s 5 regions. To calculate the average number of tourism jobs for each region and each year. We first calculate the number of total tourism jobs for each region in each month. Then we calculate the yearly average by taking the mean of 12 months within 1 year. We also change the unit of number of jobs in thousands for better visualization. "],

Region Description We divide the UK into 12 regions, with London, which hosted the Olympics, being one of them. The regions consist of the normal division of England as well as separate regions for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These regions are: 1. South West 2. Wales 3. East 4. North East 5. Northern Ireland 6. North West 7. West Midlands 8. East Midlands 9. South East 10. Scotland 11. London 12. Yorkshire and The Humber Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_England 3.1 UK GDP In order to understand the economic impact of the Olympics on the UK and its subregions, we first detail its total effect on the GDP of the UK in totality by graphing its changes over the time period from 1998 to 2018. This figure depicts the general growth of the nationwide GDP, with the exception of a brief drop during the period of the 2008 Great Recession. Through the image, we observe a consistent upwards trend from the beginning of the time series, with no particular growth rate change either in the time period following final selection or the Olympic Games. We further break down the GDP growth into the aforementioned 12 regions and analyze GDP growth by region to assess its potential effects on a smaller scale. UK Regional GDP One of the first aspects to note is the dominance of the South East and London regions in GDP size. The other regions are relatively comparable both in total GDP and growth rate, while the two regions mentioned above are both larger and exhibit more rapid growth in the time period pictured. In particular, the graph preliminarily seems to suggest that London received the bulk of the economic benefits of hosting the Olympics as the largest GDP region and its rapid growth observed during the preparation season and continuing afterward. The following table breaks displays the growth rates of each region in more detail, with darker colors representing more rapid growth. Most notably, London boasted a high growth rate during the intermediate years between selection and the games, while the other regions have far lower maximum growth rates. UK Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 1999 to 2018 Together, the plots suggest that though there may be a slight difference in regional impact and its affect on GDP, the growth rates are similar enough across all parties that we are unable to statistically verify the significance of this difference. 3.2 UK Weekly Pay To more deeply understand whether or not the Olympics had any impact on the UK, we can examine the changes in the weekly pay of workers in each of our regions of interest over time. We begin this analysis by creating a boxplot for the pay of workers in all of the UK over the years 2002 to 2019. This boxplot will show us general trends in pay as well as whether there are any outliers we need to account for. This boxplots above lead to two important conclusion: 1) There are no special outliers in pay we have to account for. 2) The median weekly pay of workers seems to grow only slightly over time, leading to an initial conclusion that the 2012 olympics may not have had a significant effect. We can further analyze this second conclusion by viewing the distribution of pay over time using a Joyplot. Although this plot does admit some changes in the distribution of weekly pay from 2002 to 2019, it reinforces the conclusion that the 2012 Olympic Games were not the cause of this change. Instead, we conclude through inspection that this shift begins around 2004 and and is nearly complete by 2008. All the years after 2008 appear to have nearly identical distributions, including 2012 and beyond. The above conclusion can be analyzed on the regional level by plotting similar Joyplots of distribution of pay for each of our regions of interest. Through inspection, we can conclude that these plots as well support the conclusion that the 2012 Olympics had no impact on the distribution of pay in any region. In fact, the near uniformity of the distributions calls into question whether any meaningful regional distinctions among worker pay are to be had in the UK. 3.3 UK International Tourism To further examine our theory that no meaningful impact was had by the London 2012 Olympics on the regional level, we can explore another metric of regional and country success: tourism. An initial analysis can be obtained by plotting the total number of tourists. This plot does show a high degree of variance in the number of tourists over time, especially when we consider seasonality, however little within it seems to support the 2012 Olympics being responsible for the uptick in visitation that occurred post 2008. We again analyze this conclusion on a regional level, both through the number of visits to each of the regions as well as through data on the spending and number of nights stayed in each region. The red line in the above plots indicates the London 2012 Olympics. Although we do not see the same constancy as in the regional pay distribution plots, we can see that changes after the London 2012 Olympics seem to have already been in progress across all three of these metrics. Because it is difficult to compare regions, especially those with lower metrics, in the above plots, we show individual plots on a per-region level below. "],

["brazil-2016-rio-olympics.html", "Chapter 5 Brazil - 2016 Rio Olympics 5.1 Brazil GDP 5.2 Brazil Monthly Income 5.3 Brazil Unemployment Rate 5.4 Brazil Tourism", " Chapter 5 Brazil - 2016 Rio Olympics Analysis of Regional Economic Impacts of Hosting Olympics on Brazil Introduction In this section, we discussed the regional difference of economic impacts on Brazil by the 2016 Olympic Games. To find whether or not there were significant differences on a regional level, we analyzed Brazil GDP, monthly income, unemployment rate and tourism over years. The 2016 Olympic Games took place at Rio de Janeiro. Rio was awarded to host the games in 2009. Region Description We divided Brazil to 5 regions, where Rio de Janeiro, the city hosted Olympics, is in the South-East Region. 1. North region: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins. 2. Northeast region: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. 3. Midwest region: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Distrito Federal (Federal District). 4. Southeast region: Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 5. South region: Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Brazil 5.1 Brazil GDP Brazil Regional GDP First, we want to visualize the regional GDP of Brazil, so we make a multiple time series plot. Also, we add two vertical lines to mark the year of final selection (2009) and the year of the Olympics (2016). From this plot, we find that from year 2002 to 2017, South East region always has a higher GDP than other 4 regions. After year 2019, the GDP for all of the 5 regions seem to increase faster than before, especially the South East region. Since 2009 is the year when Rio was awarded to host the 2016 Olympics, we come up with a hypothesis that the success of the bid for Brazil helps to increase the GDP growth rate, especially for the South East. In other words, the final selection brings different regional GDP growth impact on Brazil. However, the plot does not show a higher increasing rate for all of the 5 regions after the Olympic year 2016. Also, since our raw data does not provide the statistics after year 2017, our analysis may have some limitation to analyze the regional GDP impact after year 2016. Also, the plot shows that the GDP growth rate of South East region decreases from 2014 to 2016. Before we get to our conclusion, we want to get a closer look at regional GDP growth rate. Brazil Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2003 to 2017 From this table, we find that the highest GDP growth rate appears at year 2010 in North region, which is 24.60%, whereas the lowest GDP growth rate appears at year 2015 in South East region, which is 2.02%. Also, the regional GDP increase rate peaked at 2010 for almost all regions. Year 2010 is the year after the final selection of Olympics, whereas year 2015 is the year before the Olympic games. The table also shows that in year 2016, the GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has no significant changes compared to 2015. The highest increase in GDP growth rate appears at Mid West region in the Olympic year, but the increasing percent is \\(9.2\\%-6.84\\% = 2.36\\%\\), which is small. The changes of growth rate in year 2017 are also not significant for the 5 regions. Moreover, we find that before year 2019, the GDP growth rate for all 5 regions stays around 10+ percent, but the previous multiple time series plot shows that South East region may have a higher GDP growth rate than the other 4 regions after 2009. If we have an assumption that “before 2009, all of the 5 regions in Brazil have the same GDP growth rate”, we can then test whether the 5 regions still have the same GDP growth rate after 2009. The reason why we want to do this test is to check if the success of Olympic bid will bring a more significant GDP growth for South East region. Therefore, we want to first test our assumption by using a One-Way ANOVA test using the existing data from 2003 to 2009. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2003 to 2009: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2003 to 2009 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Description: This test is for checking whether our initial assumption holds, where the assumption is “Before the final selection year, the 5 regions in Brazil have the same GDP growth rate”. Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00143 0.0003574 0.212 0.93 ## Residuals 30 0.05062 0.0016873 Conclusion: From the summary of test table, we find that the p-value is 0.93, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we cannot say the mean of GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions have significant difference. Therefore, our initial assumption holds, then we can continue to test whether there are significant differences in the means of GDP growth rate for the 5 regions after 2009. In the next test, we still use the One-Way ANOVA test, but we use the existing data from 2010 to 2017. Second ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2010 to 2017: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2010 to 2017 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Description: Based on the assumption from the first ANOVA test, we want to conduct a second test to check whether the means of GDP growth rate for the 5 regions still remain the same from 2010 to 2017. If the test result shows a significant difference in the means, we can conclude that the succuss of 2016 Olympic bid shows a significant GDP growth on regional levels. Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00276 0.0006893 0.292 0.881 ## Residuals 35 0.08270 0.0023629 Conclusion: From the summary table, we find that the p-value is 0.881, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, from 2010 to 2017, we cannot say the GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has a significant difference. For both tests, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the year 2009 does not bring a different regional GDP growth rate impact on Brazil. This conclusion is not consistent with our initial hypothesis from the multiple time series plot. In conclusion, for Brazil regional GDP analysis, the data does not show that the Olympic games results in any significant difference in GDP growth across the regions in Brazil. 5.2 Brazil Monthly Income Monthly Income Distribution Before we analyze the regional average monthly income, we want to first visualize the distribution of monthly income for the entire country from 2012 to 2020. This will help us to get a better understanding of the overall distribution of Brazil monthly income over years. We first make a multiple boxplot over years to better visualize the robust statistics: medians, quartiles and outliers. From the boxplots we find that the median of national monthly income shows an increasing pattern from 2012 to 2020. However, the plot does not show any significant increase in the median of monthly income after the Olympic year 2016 on national-level. The Interquartile Range also increases from 2012 to 2020. Then we want to visualize the density distribution for the national monthly income, but by the boxplots, there are higher outliers for each year. If we keep those outliers, it will be hard to visualize the density plot, so we remove those higher outliers for better visualization. Note: Higher Outlier definition: points above \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. The ridgeline plot helps us to better understand the density estimation. From 2012 to 2020, the peak of density curves increases from 1000 to 1500 approximately. Also, the tail of the density curves becomes much heavier from 2012 to 2020. These observations shows that the monthly income has an increasing pattern over years. However, between 2015 and 2017, the density curves do not show a more significant increasing pattern. Regional Monthly Income Distribution in the Olympics Year 2016 Next, we want to focus on the regional-level. We pick data of the Olympic year 2016 and plot a set of histograms grouped by regions. We want to first check whether there are any significant difference in the distributions of regional monthly income. If hosting the Olympics may result in different regional impact, there may be difference in the regional distribution of monthly income in 2016. In this plot, we also remove the outliers for better visualization. The histograms shows all of the 5 regions have most density in monthly income less than 2000 but greater than 1000. Also, South East region does not show a distribution of higher monthly income than other regions in year 2016. Regional Average Monthly Income Now we move to visualize the regional average monthly income. Here we keep the outliers because we are calculating the regional average for each year. The plot shows an overall increasing pattern in monthly income for all of the 5 regions, where the income of Mid West region increases most fast from 2017 to 2018, but decreases from 2019 to 2020. The plot does not show a more significant increasing after 2016 than before. Also the patterns for all of the 5 regions do not appear to have significant difference. Regional Monthly Income Increasing Rate from 2013 to 2020 From the income increasing rate table, we find that the highest rate (11.55%) takes place at Mid West region in 2018, whereas the lowest one (-3.22%) takes place at Mid West region in 2020. For South East Region, the increasing rate in 2016 is lower than that in 2015. Together with the multiple time series plot, we find that the regional monthly income increases after the Olympic year, but the increasing rates do not become much more significant comparing with previous ones before 2016. Relationship between Brazil GDP and Monthly Income Then we create an animated scatter plot to visualize the relationship between GDP and month income by regions over years. From this plot, we find that the points are moving up and right. Each of these point represents a state in Brazil and the color shows its region. One state in Mid West region has the highest GDP and monthly income over years. Also, two states in South East region have higher GDP than the majority of states. 5.3 Brazil Unemployment Rate Another way we can analyze the potential impact of the Olympic Games on Brazil is through analyzing the unemployment rate over time. First we make a stacked bar chart to visualization the national unemployment rate from 2012 to 2019. The stacked bar chart shows that year 2017 has the highest unemployment rate, whereas year 2014 has the lowest unemployment rate. Also, the unemployment rate keeps increasing from 2015 to 2017. The above plot confirms our conclusion that the 2016 Rio Olympics did not appreciably benefit Brazil as measured through the unemployment rate. In fact, during the years that follow the Olympics the unemployment rate seems to increase, not decrease, which suggest a possible negative effect that could be the subject of future exploration. Unemployment Rate by Regions Now let’s move to the regional-level. We want to check whether the 5 regions follow a same pattern as the national unemployment rate. From 2012 to 2014, the unemployment rate decreases for the 5 regions. However, during the period between 2014 and 2017, the unemployment rate increases for the 5 regions. The unemployment rate starts to decrease after 2017. The regions follow the same pattern as the national pattern, except Mid West region has an increasing unemployment rate from 2018 to 2019. For more precise conclusion, we also calculate the exact regional unemployment rate increasing rate. Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate by Regions from 2013 to 2019 Since 2014, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing for all of the 5 regions until 2017. The highest increasing rate appears at year 2016 which is the Olympics year for all of the 5 regions. The unemployment rate drops starting from 2018. Therefore, the 2016 Rio Olympic games did not benifit Brazil’s unemployment rate. There are no significant difference in regional unemployment pattern observed as well. 5.4 Brazil Tourism Now we want to analyze Brazil tourism to check whether the Olympics benifits the tourism, especially for the South East region. From the multiple time series plot, we find that from 2006 to 2018, South East region alwasys has a much higher number of tourism jobs than the other regions. After 2009, the final selection year, all of the 5 regions seems to increase faster than before in the number of tourism jobs. However, from 2015 to 2017, South East region seems to decreases slightly. This shows that the Olympics does not necessarily increase the number of tourism jobs for South East region. The decreasing in number of tourism jobs in South East region complies with the pattern of Brazil unemployment rate. "],
