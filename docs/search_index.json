The variable region is a smaller region in state. This dataset covers Brazil GDP from year 2002 to 2017. Since the raw data is on a state-level of Brazil GDP over years, we add an additional variable larger_region to indicate which of the 5 regions a row belongs to. The raw data has GDP values in thousands of Reals. For better visualization, we modify the unit to trillions of Reals. For regional GDP calculation, we simply add the GDP value of all states within one larger region to get the result. For regional GDP growth rate calculation, we use the formula: (value of this year - value of last year)/value of last year, and keep two decimals for the percentage of growth rate. "],

To find whether or not there were significant differences on a regional level, we analyzed Brazil GDP, monthly income, unemployment rate and tourism over years. The 2016 Olympic Games took place at Rio de Janeiro. Rio was awarded to host the games in 2009. Region Description We divided Brazil to 5 regions, where Rio de Janeiro, the city hosted Olympics, is in the South-East Region. 1. North region: Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima and Tocantins. 2. Northeast region: Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. 3. Midwest region: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Distrito Federal (Federal District). 4. Southeast region: Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 5. South region: Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Brazil 5.1 Brazil GDP Brazil Regional GDP First, we want to visualize the regional GDP of Brazil, so we make a multiple time series plot. Also, we add two vertical lines to mark the year of final selection (2009) and the year of the Olympics (2016). From this plot, we find that from year 2002 to 2017, South East region always has a higher GDP than other 4 regions. After year 2019, the GDP for all of the 5 regions seem to increase faster than before, especially the South East region. Since 2009 is the year when Rio was awared to host the 2016 Olympics, we come up with a hypothesis that the success of the bid for Brazil helps to increase the GDP growth rate, especially for the South East. However, the plot does not show a higher increasing rate for all of the 5 regions after the Olympic year 2016. Also, since our raw data does not provide the statistics after year 2017, our analysis may have some limitation to analyze the regional GDP impact after year 2016. Before we get to our conclusion, we want to get a closer look at regional GDP growth rate. Brazil Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2003 to 2017 We want to test our hypothesis using two ANOVA tests: one is for the regional GDP growth rate from year 2003 to 2009; another one is for the regional GDP growth rate from year 2010 to 2017. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2003 to 2009: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2003 to 2009 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Test: One-Way ANOVA Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00143 0.0003574 0.212 0.93 ## Residuals 30 0.05062 0.0016873 Conclusion: The p-value is 0.93, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2010 to 2017: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2010 to 2017 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Test: One-Way ANOVA Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00276 0.0006893 0.292 0.881 ## Residuals 35 0.08270 0.0023629 Conclusion: The p-value is 0.881, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, for both tests, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we cannot say that the mean GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has significant difference. This also shows that the event of Olympic games does not impact on the GDP growth rate for regions in Brazil differenly. 5.2 Brazil Monthly Income Source Data: brazil_monthly_income.csv, brazil_unemployment.csv Monthly Income Distribution First, take a view at the distribution of monthly income for the entire country from 2012 to 2020: Note: We dropped missing values. From the Boxplots wo can find that the median of monthly income shows an increasing pattern from 2012 to 2020. However, there are higher outliers for each year, so we remove those higher outliers for further analysis on density estimation for better visualization. Higher Outlier definition: points above \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. Regional Monthly Income Distribution in the Olympics Year 2016 Observation: Our hypothesis may be “hosting the Olympics can increase peoples’ income in the hosting city/region”. However, from this plot we find that the South East Region does not show a distribution of higher monthly income in year 2016. Regional Average Monthly Income Now we want to visualize the regional average monthly income. Here we keep the outliers because we are calculating the regional average for each year. Regional Monthly Income Increasing Rate from 2013 to 2020 Observation: 1. Seems no significant difference of increasing rate between the 5 regions around year 2016. 2. For South East Region, the increasing rate in 2016 is lower than that in 2015. (Why?) 5.3 Brazil Unemployment Rate From this plot we find that year 2017 has the highest average unemployment rate. Also, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing from 2015 to 2017. Unemployment Rate by Regions Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate by Regions from 2013 to 2019 Obserevation: Since 2014, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing for all of the 5 regions until 2017. The highest increasing rate appears at year 2016 which is the Olympics year for all of the 5 regions. 5.4 Brazil Tourism Source Data: brazil_tourism_jobs.csv Brazil International Tourists 5.5 Interactive "]
