Brazil GDP 6.2 2. Brazil Monthly Income &amp; Unemployment Rate 6.3 3. Brazil Tourism", " Chapter 6 Preliminary Analysis of Economic impacts on Brazil hosting Olympics by Regions We can divide Brazil to 5 regions, where Rio de Janeiro is in the South-East Region. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Brazil 6.1 1. Brazil GDP Source Data: brazil_gdp.csv 6.1.1 1.1 Brazil Regional GDP 6.1.2 1.2 Brazil Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2013 to 2017 6.1.2.1 Observation: South East Region of Brazil has much higher GDP than other 4 regions over years. Seems no significant increasing on Brazil regional GDP by 2016 Rio Olympics. Seems changes of regional GDP are unrelated to the Olympic games. 6.2 2. Brazil Monthly Income &amp; Unemployment Rate Source Data: brazil_monthly_income.csv, brazil_unemployment.csv 6.2.1 2.1. Monthly Income Distribution First, take a view at the distribution of monthly income for the entire country from 2012 to 2020: Note: We dropped missing values. From the Boxplots wo can find that the median of monthly income shows an increasing pattern from 2012 to 2020. However, there are higher outliers for each year, so we remove those higher outliers for further analysis on density estimation for better visualization. Higher Outlier definition: points above \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. 6.2.2 2.2 Regional Monthly Income Distribution in the Olympics Year 2016 6.2.2.1 Observation: Our hypothesis may be “hosting the Olympics can increase peoples’ income in the hosting city/region”. However, from this plot we find that the South East Region does not show a distribution of higher monthly income in year 2016. 6.2.3 2.3 Regional Average Monthly Income Now we want to visualize the regional average monthly income. Here we keep the outliers because we are calculating the regional average for each year. 6.2.4 2.4 Regional Monthly Income Increasing Rate from 2012 to 2020 6.2.4.1 Observation: Seems no significant difference of increasing rate between the 5 regions around year 2016. For South East Region, the increasing rate in 2016 is lower than that in 2015. (Why?) 6.2.5 2.5. Unemployment Rate From this plot we find that year 2017 has the highest average unemployment rate. Also, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing from 2015 to 2017. 6.2.6 2.6 Unemployment Rate by Regions 6.2.7 2.7 Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate by Regions from 2012 to 2019 6.2.7.1 Obserevation: Since 2014, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing for all of the 5 regions until 2017. The highest increasing rate appears at year 2016 which is the Olympics year for all of the 5 regions. 6.3 3.
