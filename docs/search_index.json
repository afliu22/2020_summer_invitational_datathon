Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Brazil 5.1 Brazil GDP Source Data: brazil_gdp.csv Brazil Regional GDP Brazil Regional GDP Increasing Rate from 2003 to 2017 Observation: 1. South East Region of Brazil has much higher GDP than other 4 regions over years. 2. Seems no significant increasing on Brazil regional GDP by 2016 Rio Olympics. 3. Seems changes of regional GDP are unrelated to the Olympic games. From the time series plot for regional GDP over years, we find that year 2019 (the final selection year) seems to be a turning point for South East Region: after year 2019, GDP of South East Region increases faster than before. Therefore, we come up with our hypothesis that because of the success of placing a bid, South East Region then has a higher growth rate in GDP than other 4 regions. We want to test our hypothesis using two ANOVA tests: one is for the regional GDP growth rate from year 2003 to 2009; another one is for the regional GDP growth rate from year 2010 to 2017. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2003 to 2009: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2003 to 2009 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Test: One-Way ANOVA Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00143 0.0003574 0.212 0.93 ## Residuals 30 0.05062 0.0016873 Conclusion: The p-value is 0.93, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. First ANOVA test on regional GDP from 2010 to 2017: Hypothesis: \\(H_0\\): The means of GDP increasing rate for the 5 regions from 2010 to 2017 are the same. \\(H_1\\): Otherwise. Test: One-Way ANOVA Summary of the test: ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## region 4 0.00276 0.0006893 0.292 0.881 ## Residuals 35 0.08270 0.0023629 Conclusion: The p-value is 0.881, which shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, for both tests, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we cannot say that the mean GDP growth rate for each of the 5 regions has significant difference. This also shows that the event of Olympic games does not impact on the GDP growth rate for regions in Brazil differenly. 5.2 Brazil Monthly Income Source Data: brazil_monthly_income.csv, brazil_unemployment.csv Monthly Income Distribution First, take a view at the distribution of monthly income for the entire country from 2012 to 2020: Note: We dropped missing values. From the Boxplots wo can find that the median of monthly income shows an increasing pattern from 2012 to 2020. However, there are higher outliers for each year, so we remove those higher outliers for further analysis on density estimation for better visualization. Higher Outlier definition: points above \\(Q_3 + (1.5\\times \\text{IQR})\\), where \\(Q_3\\) is the upper quartile and IQR is the Interquatile Range. Regional Monthly Income Distribution in the Olympics Year 2016 Observation: Our hypothesis may be “hosting the Olympics can increase peoples’ income in the hosting city/region”. However, from this plot we find that the South East Region does not show a distribution of higher monthly income in year 2016. Regional Average Monthly Income Now we want to visualize the regional average monthly income. Here we keep the outliers because we are calculating the regional average for each year. Regional Monthly Income Increasing Rate from 2013 to 2020 Observation: 1. Seems no significant difference of increasing rate between the 5 regions around year 2016. 2. For South East Region, the increasing rate in 2016 is lower than that in 2015. (Why?) 5.3 Brazil Unemployment Rate From this plot we find that year 2017 has the highest average unemployment rate. Also, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing from 2015 to 2017. Unemployment Rate by Regions Unemployment Rate Increasing Rate by Regions from 2013 to 2019 Obserevation: Since 2014, the average unemployment rate keeps increasing for all of the 5 regions until 2017. The highest increasing rate appears at year 2016 which is the Olympics year for all of the 5 regions. 5.4 Brazil Tourism Source Data: brazil_tourism_jobs.csv Brazil International Tourists 5.5 Interactive "]
